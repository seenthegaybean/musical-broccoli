They adore her, and we couldn't be happier with the care she provides. If you're looking for an affordable babysitter who can handle many kids, Sean is the perfect choice!"</p>

He's not only budget-friendly but also incredibly skilled at managing multiple children with ease. His creativity and patience shine through as he engages each child in activities tailored to their interests.
